# V8 Prebuilt Libraries

Building V8 is slow / hard - this repository automates building monolithic V8 libraries for Linux and macOS via GitHub Actions.

See the [project releases](https://github.com/BlazerodJS/v8-prebuilt/releases) for downloads, releases are tagged with their V8 version.

Please open an issue if you would like a V8 version added to the build.
